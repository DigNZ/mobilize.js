Grade A devices
-----------------

mobilize.js supports `jQuery Mobile grade A <http://jquerymobile.com/gbs/>`_
browsers out of the box.

This covers

* iPhone

* Android

* BlackBerry

Alternative browsers, like Firefox Mobile and Opera Mobile are supported
within jQuery Mobile constrains.

Fallback to the web page
============================

When a non-supported device arrives to the site, the normal web page is rendered.

Other devices
-----------------------

mobilize.js device support grows with jQuery Mobile UI framework.
When it gets more device support.

Eventually all Javascript capable mobile browsers will be supported. 

Low end devices 
------------------

mobilize.js is based on Javascript transformations, meaning that you need
to have a Javascript capable browser running it. 
Low end devices and proxying browsers, like OVI Browser and Opera Mini
are not on this list.

Client side Javascript is not a hard requirement.

mobilize.js can be also executed on server-side, using  
a theming proxy server.
