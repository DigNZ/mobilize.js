What are you doing Uncle Coder?

Mobilizing my websites.

Oh... isn't that very difficult task? You need to care about 
thousand of different devices,  screen sizes, formats,
standards and everything.

Not anymore. Mobilize.js is a new open source
project which allows you to mobilize any web system
with Javascript, optionally some server-side code.

Mobilize.js is what HTML was orignally meant to be.
It leaves the representation content to the client.
Since it transforms the content on the client side,
you don't need any kind of device detection, but
the device itself knowns what it is doing.
Modern phones are smart, after all.

Oooh.. sounds interesting. Does it 
work with my Wordpress site?

Yes. It has Wordpress plug-in available out of the box.

Does it work with my custom web site?

Yes. It works any site where you can put script tags.

Does it work with Microsoft Sharepoint?

Yes.

Does it...

Yes.

This is awesome. I'll start following mobilize.js
in Twitter right away and subscribe to 
their RSS feed. I'll also go to the forum
to see if they can answer my questions.

It's time to chew bubble gum and
mobilize web sites. And I am all 
out of gum.
